## Projects: 
-  Morse Code - *link to your repo*
	- This Project's objective was to design a Morse code signaler with a LED light or sound buzzer. The computer (Raspberry Pi) should be able to (1) convert digital user input into a Morse code message and (2) also be able to receive user input in the form of a touch sensor and output messages according to the duration for which the touch sensor is activated.
